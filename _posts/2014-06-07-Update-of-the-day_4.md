### Status as of June 7, 2014

#### Changes
 
* Mesh is fully generated with half-edge library
* it is not that great for generating leaf mesh though...
* OBJ export is working as intended.


#### Next step: 

* UV are still not handled
* The mesh generation time is quite long (from 200ms to 500ms)
* Leaves are not coorectly placed... there is a bug here
* Saving parameters is now working properly
