### Status as of May 24, 2014

#### Changes
 
* The mesh seems properly generated
* Looks like the leaf bending trick is creating issues (palm for instance)
* A few enhancements here and there.
* Parameters can be changed (sort of, lots of bugs there).
* Arbaro documentation is now displayed
* File Open/Save/Save as and New menu items are implemented
* The various leave type are also implemented. There is a bug with the Spherical leaves
* Bad entries for parameters triggers a MessageBox rather than an unhandled exception.

#### Next step: 

* Check the leaf bend 
* Add UV and normals to the mesh
* Export as .obj file format
* Review all parameters
