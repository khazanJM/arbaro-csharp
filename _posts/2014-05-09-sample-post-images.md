Arbaro C# is a project to port Arbaro to C#.
Arbaro is a cool, though pretty old, tree generator developed using Java.
It implements ideas developed by Weber & Penn in a somewhat famous paper.
The original Arbaro implementation can be found [here](http://arbaro.sourceforge.net). The Weber & Penn paper: Creation and rendering of realistic tree can be found [here](https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall02/cps124/resources/p119-weber.pdf)

The current implementation is able to calculate a tree and display its skeleton (skipping subsegments).
Basically it is still extremely early stages... A lot of work still needed to have something even remotely useful.
