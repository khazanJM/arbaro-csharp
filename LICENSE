I'm not a legal person.
This is basically a port of Arbaro to C# with (possibly) tons of modifications.
To the extent that at some point nothing will be left of Arbaro.
I don't know how Arbaro licensing is involved.
As far as I'm concerned everything I provide here is public domain.
I will add a comment (the like of "source code ported from Arbaro") in all files where it is the case.
